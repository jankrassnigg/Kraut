# Kraut

Kraut is a program to procedurally generate plants, especially trees. Through a set of parameters you specify how a tree is supposed to grow. Various different, but similar trees can be generated from the same specification. Additionally there is a manual editing mode, which allows to easily paint branches by hand, such that very unique trees can be created.

## General Feature Set

* Procedural growth of branches and fronds.
* Easily create thousands of variations from the same tree specification.
* Interactive WYSIWYG editor.
* Undo / Redo system.
* Export Meshes to OBJ, FBX or custom format.
* "Leafcard" mode to easily create textures which can be used to represent entire branches. This enables you to create highly detailed looking trees without many polygons.
* Exported leafcard textures are automatically processed to be well suited for mipmap creation.
* Automatic computation of up to five level-of-detail meshes with much reduced polygon counts.
* LODs include Impostor and Billboard mode.
* Many tweakable options to get the best quality out of level-of-detail meshes.
* Manual editing mode that allows to easily paint unique branches exactly as desired.
* On manually created branches additional procedural branches may be grown.
* "Physical Simulation" mode: Branches will try to grow around obstacles, such as other branches or additional objects that can be loaded from OBJ files. This allows to create a tree that shall fit perfectly into some corner of a game level.
* Several sample trees and sample leafcards included.

## License

Tree-meshes generated with Kraut Tree Creator can be used free of charge for both commercial and non-commercial projects. However, it would be nice if you let us now about it and also to mention Kraut in your application's credits.
