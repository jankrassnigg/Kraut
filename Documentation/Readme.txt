The license information can be found in the 'About' dialog in Kraut Creator. Click on the right most icon in the toolbar (a tree icon) to open it up.


Documentation:
--------------

Kraut is still in a very early development phase. Therefore there is no high-level documentation, as many features might still change.

However all GUI elements have tooltips, which try to explain their effect as good as possible. So please read the tooltips. Also just open some of the sample trees and check out how they are configured.
